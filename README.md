# traj_plan
The project implements an online trajectory planning algorithm for astronomical telescope control systems. It uses a 7-segment trajectory with 3rd-degree polynomials on each segment, considering initial and final velocity, acceleration, kinematic limits, and continuity of an acceleration function.
